    // I could construct "expectedResults" with the list of grocery items as above, but I want to exercise GroceryList's extraction
    // operator.  To do that, I could:
    //   1) read the list of grocery items from standard input and type the data at the keyboard, but that is time consuming and
    //      error prone.  That's easily handled by creating a text file with grocery item data then redirecting that text file to
    //      standard input at the command line when launching the program.  But then I would have to separately maintain that file
    //      and include it in the set of student files.  More importantly, that would prevent you from doing that in the TO-DO
    //      section below.
    //   2) open a text file directly using either command line arguments that supply the file's path and name, or hard coding the
    //      file's path and name.  But that would require using (and understanding) the standard's ifstream interface, which is easy
    //      enough given sufficient time, but I don't want to go down that rabbit hole in this course.
    //   3) create an in-memory text file (well, more accurately, an in-memory input stream) and read from there.  This allows me to
    //      exercise the extraction operator while avoiding the perils described in options 1) and 2) above.
    // So, as a design decision, let's chose option 3), create an in-memory input stream and read from there.
